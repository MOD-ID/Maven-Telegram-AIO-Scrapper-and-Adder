# Instructions
Install the latest python version from https://www.python.org/downloads/. <br>
Extract the zip file and run ``Install Requirements.bat`` <br>
Wait for pip to finish installing the required modules <br>

# Running
Open ``Setup.py``. This will guide you through the setup process.
Once open you should see something like this<br>

Everything from this point should be pretty straight forward as I took special care into making everything beginner friendly<br>

Once all the steps are completed you should be greeted by a window which looks like this. If you completed the previous steps properly you should be able to see your mobile number(s)<br>
You can now use the pannel to scrape and add members to your own group!<br>
Have fun using maven <3!<br>
